# Generate Ladder Sequence (GLS)

A Simple Ladder Logic Auto-Generator

## Description
Generate Ladder Sequence (GLS) is a tool that converts cylinder movement sequences (like A+B-C+) into a readable ladder logic format.
It automatically creates grouped outputs, subsequences, and visual ladder logic blocks, helping users build ladder diagrams faster and more accurately.

It helps users create ladder diagrams faster and more accurately compared to manual drawing.

## ADVANTAGES:
- Fast ladder generation
- Accurate and consistent logic
- No input limit 
- Simple for beginners
- Helpful for students & automation projects

---

## DISADVANTAGES:
- Works only with cylinder-type (+/–) outputs
- No timer instructions (TON/TOFF)
- No advanced PLC commands
- Not intended for full PLC program generation
- Only creates structural ladder layout

---

## How to Use
1. Enter a sequence (example: `A+B-C+/C-A-`)  
2. Press **ENTER**  
3. GLS will display:  
   - Output sequence  
   - Subsequence  
   - Relay Group Count
   - Ladder structure
